## Question 1 : 
Describe the properties of a database table in a relational database

---

A table is a collection of related data held in a table format within a database. It consists of columns of vertical data and rows of horizontal data. 

Relation Database Management Systems (RDBMS) are an efficent and common choice for storing ---

Relational databases have the following properties: 

- Values are Atomic
- All of the values in a column have the same data type 
- Each row is unique 
- The sequence of column is insignificant. 
- Each column has a unique name
- Integrity constraints maintain data consistency across multiple tables.

## Question 2 :
Identify the three possible relationships between entities in a relational database and explain how primary and foreign keys are used to create a many-to-many relationship between tables. 

## Question 3: 
Constraints are restrictions on data. Describe three constrains which can be applied to ensure data integrity in a relational database.

## Question 4:
Explain how data types enforce data integrity in a relational database. 

## Question 5:
SQL provides operations for the definition and manipulation of data in a relational database. Describe the function of three operators and support your answer with an example.

In SQL, Data Manipulation Language (DML) is defined as language used to for adding, deleting and modifying data in a database. Statements written in DML make changes the data that is stored within database objects but does not make changes to the schema of the database object. 

Common DML operations that are included in most Structured Query Language (SQL) distributions include: 

- SELECT: Query data in the database. Allows the database user to retrieve data from the database based on specific input criteria. The `SELECT` statement supports various optional clauses including: 
The `FROM` clause, which specifies the name of the table(s) to retrieve results from.
The `WHERE` clause, which allows filtering of results that meet specific conditions. 
The `ORDER BY`clause which specified how to order returned rows. 
The `GROUP BY` clause, which allows for grouping of rows that share a property.


- INSERT: Adds data to a table in a relational database. The values included in the insert statement must satisfy all of the existing constraints that apply to the fields of the table. The `INSERT` statement takes the following required clauses:
The `INTO` clause, specifies the table and columns where data is added too. 
The `VALUES` clause, specifies that data points that are added to the table.


- DELETE: Removes data from a table in a relational database. The `DELETE` command supports the following additional clauses;
The `FROM` clause, specifies the table from which data will be deleted from.
The `WHERE` clause, which allows filtering of results that meet specific conditions.

Care must be taken to maintain referential integrity when adding, modifying or deleting records with related tables, such as tables that describe many-to-many relationships. For this reason SQL `TRIGGERS` should be added to relational tables to ensure that all necessary changes in response to a command are made at the same time and that the referential integrity of the database is maintained. 

The following is an example of a valid SQL syntax query using the `SELECT` command demonstrating the retrieval of OrderDateKey and TotalSales records `FROM` the FactInternetSales table:

``` sql
# Syntax for `SELECT` commands 

SELECT OrderDateKey, SUM(SalesAmount) AS TotalSales
FROM FactInternetSales
WHERE OrderDateKey > '20020801'
GROUP BY OrderDateKey
ORDER BY OrderDateKey;
```


## Question 6: 
Relational database make data manipulation highly effective using SQL queries. Describe how the INNER JOIN query retrieves data from multiple tables.
