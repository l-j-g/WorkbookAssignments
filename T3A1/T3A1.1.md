Q1.

Develop a data flow diagram which shows the flow of data in an organisation’s information system.

----

![Data Flow Diagram for Ebay](EbayDFD.1.3.svg)
Figure 1: High-Level Dataflow Diagram of Ebay

The above figure describes at a high level the primary dataflow for the website [Ebay](https://www.ebay.com).

Ebay is a online auction house with a focus on consumer to consumer sales.

**The primary external entities are:**

1. Buyers: Registered Users who are authorised to bid and participate in live auctions.
2. Sellers: Registered Users who are authorised to list items for sale on the site.

**The processes involved in the operation of the website are:**

1. View - Login: Receives login credentials attempts from existing users, registers new users or resets forgotten passwords by checking if the provided login credentials exist in the database `DB1: User Credentials`.
2. Create Auction: A process of the Auction Controller that is used by Sellers create new auction listings. The Seller provides details about the item they intend to sell, which are used to create a new auction listing in `DB3: Live Auctions`. This process also triggers the User Controller - track auction Process, to notify the seller of the status of the auction.
3. Query: A process of the Auction Controller that queries `DB3: Live Auctions` for live auctions that match search criteria. The database responds with matching auctions and displays a list of auctions for the user to browse.
4. View - Auction Detail: Following the Query process above, a user may select a specific auction to view further details and participate in the auction. A request containing the AuctionID is sent to `DB3: Live Auctions` and returns details about the AuctionID that are displayed to the user.
5. Bid: A process of the Auction Controller that is used by Buyers to place a bid for a live auction. Information about the bid is entered into `DB3: Live Auctions` and the Track Auction process is triggered, to notify the user of the status of the auction they are participating in.
6. Track Auction: A process of the User Controller that is triggered by user activity participating in an auction (either a buyer or a seller). The user activity is registered in `DB2: User History` which stores data about auctions that the user is currently participating in.

**The databases involved in operation of the website are:**

1. `DB1: User Credentials` : Stores users login credentials.
2. `DB2: User History` : Stores details about auctions that users have participated in.
3. `DB3: Live Auctions` : Stores details about live auctions.

Q2.

Develop an application architecture diagram which describes relationships between technologies and applications within an organisation’s information system.

----

![Application Architecture Diagram for Ebay](EbayAAD.svg)
Figure 2: Application Architecture Diagram for Ebay

The Ebay application architecture ebay is strongly based on Java and Javascript, utilising a partial J2EE technology stack in order to streamline development.

**For Database Systems:**

Ebay utilise a variety of different databases to address the requirements of different applications.

- Oracle RDS: RDS databases from Oracle are used to store and process ordered transactions where reliability, consistency and availability a priority - such as user login details and auction bid orders.
- Cassandra: NoSQL distributed databases are used for processing large datasets at high speed. Data stored in these databases are accessed by time critical processes such as search queries.
- Hadoop: Non time-critical, processing of historical big data is preformed offline on hadoop databases to preform process such as data analytics and machine learning optimisaiton.

**Back End:** 
- Apache Tomcat: Is a Java based web server environment that provides clustering support and load balancing, allowing individual instances of Ebay web applications to dynamically scale with demand.

 **Front End:**

- Node.js: Node.js is used in the frontend layer due to its capability to stream chuncks of data & html to the client (browser). This in effect improves preformance latency by enabling progressive html rendering and asyncronous loading of webpages that are displayed as the data of the page is recieved. 

- Marko: HTML Rendering, view layer. Template Engine, 



 The Java SDK's primary advantage is that it hides much of the complexity inherent in using services across the Internet. It enables developers to start developing eBay applications quickly, and develop them efficiently.

 Both front end and backend layers use Node.js. Node.js is asynchronous and single-thread allowing for enchanged scalability

Q3. Identify TWO products, services or priorities of an organisation and for each:

- explain how their application stack contributes to the delivery of the service or priority (2 marks)

- speculate why they chose the particular application or combination of applications (1 mark)

Ebay experiances an enormous amount of activity:

- 250 million registered users
- 2 billion image files
- $2,000 in transactions per second
- Over 1 billion page views per day
- 100 million items in over 50,000 categories
- Over 2 petabytes of data
- 5.5 billion API calls per day

Two priorities for the organisation is to optimise the latency and scalabity of their systems.

1. Latency

Unlike a traditional search engine 

 To increase preformance, Ebay partition their databases both functionally (e.g. buying, selling and search are all different databases) as well as horizontally by 'sharding' or fragmenting databases by set criteria such as a 


Magnitude:
250 mil users
2 billion images
2,000 $ trades per second
1 billion+ page vies a day
100 mil items, 50,000 categories
2 petabytes of data.
5.5 billion api calls.

Dynamic: Change site constantly - every 2 weeks 100,000 lines of new code.
300 features each quarter, 38 countries.
48 billion SQL statements each day.
 
Scalability & Evolution of the System
Availability
Latency
Managability
Cost, energy,

Strategies:
Partition Everything - Split it, scale it. Individual chunks.  Constant Cost/Preformance Unit. - Rolling Updates. Partition the data, 

Functional segmentation - Buying, Selling, Search are distinct functions databases
- Items/Transactions
- Users expect search engine to be upgraded in real time. traditional batch mode doesnt really work, need real time.

Horizontal Splitting - Take the functional database and divide it up : segment by key, range, lookup/ routing table. 'sharding'
Ebay use Distributed transactions.
Distributed transactions are bad for scaling -> Partioning for scalability, Avaliability, loose consistency.  (PAC)
Split databases -> loose transaction consistency 
Consistency through ordered transaction. A -> B ->

Critical operations -> e.g. bid order are a ordered transaction.
Most cases dont need to be consistent, 

Application Tier: Java J2E - Applets. Stateless. All information is stored in cookie. 'scractch' databses. 

Search Infrastructure: Functional - Read Only.

Separated from transactional database. -> Updates.
Not a relational search engine: inverted index ->



Agregate results from shards.

Async: larger system, more processing asyc the better. If a and b are not linked they can scale independently.

Tiers of availability. Latency - respond to user faster but transact data slower.

Periodic Batch: Event Streams, 'JMS' approach - interesting events. 

Process (Bid, Buy, List ect.) also lists an 'event' in a table.

Queue table: Asyc - shard - preformant system. 

Do we need ACID - Consistency?, Async Event used to recover from failed transaction.

Want events to be reflected in search as soon as possible. Each search database shard has a search feeder application, which is polling changes primary database for changes. Intermediate Persistance - Like a cache for the next refresh.

Batching: Old style transaction processing, not everything for messaging. Best for scheduled, infrequent or expensive. 1 once per hour, 1 per week, ect.

Async

3. Automation

Adapt to environment - scalability effect without needing more humans. More functionality - free human resource to do otherthings.

Ideally, Humans should be aware but not involved.

Backwards compatability to for database, interface. - Rollout, rollback. 

Recovery from failure

- explain how their application stack contributes to the delivery of the service or priority (2 marks)

- speculate why they chose the particular application or combination of applications (1 mark)
