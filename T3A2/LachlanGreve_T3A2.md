## Written Report/Proposal - Research and Improve an Application Stack

# Brief

---

Based on your work in workbook 1.1, provide an application stack diagram for one product or service of the application you are considering. If the application stack includes multiple similar technologies which may be used for your product, select the one you think is most likely to be used to include in your diagram.
    (CMP1042-2.1) Mark down which technologies fall into:
        The Presentation Layer of the stack 
        The Application Layer of the stack
        The Data Access Layer of the stack
        (CMP1042-2.3) Pick three technologies and for each:
        describe in a short paragraph its role in the stack and how it relates to its neighbouring technologies. 
    Pick two technologies and for each:
        (CMP1042-2.2) Discuss what physical hardware this technology is most likely delivered on. 
        (CMP1042-5.3) Include a table comparing its features and benefits to similar alternative technologies
Examine the applicationâ€™s developer API and:
    (CMP1042-3.2) Describe TWO processes for the input and output of data based on the company's API and how they achieve organisational objectives.
    (This criterion is linked to a learning outcomeCMP1042-5.1) Describe the functions of the API that facilitate your chosen feature or service
    (This criterion is linked to a learning outcomeCMP1042-3.1, PRG1048-1.1) Create an entity relationship diagram to depict the database tables that you believe are likely to be employed by the system you are investigating in order to provide your chosen service or product. You are free to speculate on the properties of entities and the relationships between entities.
    (CMP1042-3.3) Supplementary to this diagram, suggest a way in which these entities might be altered in order to add an extra piece of functionality to the product or service. Explain how you think this would improve the service.
        (CMP1042-5.2) Explain what technologies or app functionality would need to be added to support this. Would this be difficult or expensive to implement?
        (This criterion is linked to a learning outcomePRG1048-1.2) Create a modified entity relationship diagram that depicts your planned change
